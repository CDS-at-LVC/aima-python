    "\n",
    "The class `PropKB` can be used to represent a knowledge base of propositional logic sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the class `KB` has four methods, apart from `__init__`. A point to note here: the `ask` method simply calls the `ask_generator` method. Thus, this one has already been implemented, and what you'll have to actually implement when you create your own knowledge base class (though you'll probably never need to, considering the ones we've created for you) will be the `ask_generator` function and not the `ask` function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PropKB` now.\n",
    "* `__init__(self, sentence=None)` : The constructor `__init__` creates a single field `clauses` which will be a list of all the sentences of the knowledge base. Note that each one of these sentences will be a 'clause' i.e. a sentence which is made up of only literals and `or`s.\n",
    "* `tell(self, sentence)` : When you want to add a sentence to the KB, you use the `tell` method. This method takes a sentence, converts it to its CNF, extracts all the clauses, and adds all these clauses to the `clauses` field. So, you need not worry about `tell`ing only clauses to the knowledge base. You can `tell` the knowledge base a sentence in any form that you wish; converting it to CNF and adding the resulting clauses will be handled by the `tell` method.\n",
    "* `ask_generator(self, query)` : The `ask_generator` function is used by the `ask` function. It calls the `tt_entails` function, which in turn returns `True` if the knowledge base entails query and `False` otherwise. The `ask_generator` itself returns an empty dict `{}` if the knowledge base entails query and `None` otherwise. This might seem a little bit weird to you. After all, it makes more sense just to return a `True` or a `False` instead of the `{}` or `None` But this is done to maintain consistency with the way things are in First-Order Logic, where an `ask_generator` function is supposed to return all the substitutions that make the query true. Hence the dict, to return all these substitutions. I will be mostly be using the `ask` function which returns a `{}` or a `False`, but if you don't like this, you can always use the `ask_if_true` function which returns a `True` or a `False`.\n",
    "* `retract(self, sentence)` : This function removes all the clauses of the sentence given, from the knowledge base. Like the `tell` function, you don't have to pass clauses to remove them from the knowledge base; any sentence will do fine. The function will take care of converting that sentence to clauses and then remove those."

    "Recall that our goal is to check whether $\\text{KB} \\vDash \\alpha$ i.e. is $\\text{KB} \\implies \\alpha$ true in every model. Suppose we wanted to check if $P \\implies Q$ is valid. We check the satisfiability of $\\neg (P \\implies Q)$, which can be rewritten as $P \\land \\neg Q$. If $P \\land \\neg Q$ is unsatisfiable, then $P \\implies Q$ must be true in all models. This gives us the result \"$\\text{KB} \\vDash \\alpha$ <em>if and only if</em> $\\text{KB} \\land \\neg \\alpha$ is unsatisfiable\".<br/>\n",
    "This technique corresponds to <em>proof by <strong>contradiction</strong></em>, a standard mathematical proof technique. We assume $\\alpha$ to be false and show that this leads to a contradiction with known axioms in $\\text{KB}$. We obtain a contradiction by making valid inferences using inference rules. In this proof we use a single inference rule, <strong>resolution</strong> which states $(l_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor l_k) \\land (m_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor m_n) \\land (l_i \\iff \\neg m_j) \\implies l_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor l_{i - 1} \\lor l_{i + 1} \\lor \\dots \\lor l_k \\lor m_1 \\lor \\dots \\lor m_{j - 1} \\lor m_{j + 1} \\lor \\dots \\lor m_n$. Applying the resolution yields us a clause which we add to the KB. We keep doing this until:\n",

    "### Forward and backward chaining\n",
    "Previously, we said we will look at two algorithms to check if a sentence is entailed by the `KB`. Here's a third one. \n",
    "The difference here is that our goal now is to determine if a knowledge base of definite clauses entails a single proposition symbol *q* - the query.\n",
    "There is a catch however - the knowledge base can only contain **Horn clauses**.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "#### Horn Clauses\n",
    "Horn clauses can be defined as a *disjunction* of *literals* with **at most** one positive literal. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A Horn clause with exactly one positive literal is called a *definite clause*.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A Horn clause might look like \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$\\neg a\\lor\\neg b\\lor\\neg c\\lor\\neg d... \\lor z$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This, coincidentally, is also a definite clause.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Using De Morgan's laws, the example above can be simplified to \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$a\\land b\\land c\\land d ... \\implies z$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This seems like a logical representation of how humans process known data and facts. \n",
    "Assuming percepts `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ... to be true simultaneously, we can infer `z` to also be true at that point in time. \n",
    "There are some interesting aspects of Horn clauses that make algorithmic inference or *resolution* easier.\n",
    "- Definite clauses can be written as implications:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The most important simplification a definite clause provides is that it can be written as an implication.\n",
    "The premise (or the knowledge that leads to the implication) is a conjunction of positive literals.\n",
    "The conclusion (the implied statement) is also a positive literal.\n",
    "The sentence thus becomes easier to understand.\n",
    "The premise and the conclusion are conventionally called the *body* and the *head* respectively.\n",
    "A single positive literal is called a *fact*.\n",
    "- Forward chaining and backward chaining can be used for inference from Horn clauses:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Forward chaining is semantically identical to `AND-OR-Graph-Search` from the chapter on search algorithms.\n",
    "Implementational details will be explained shortly.\n",
    "- Deciding entailment with Horn clauses is linear in size of the knowledge base:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Surprisingly, the forward and backward chaining algorithms traverse each element of the knowledge base at most once, greatly simplifying the problem.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The function `pl_fc_entails` implements forward chaining to see if a knowledge base `KB` entails a symbol `q`.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Before we proceed further, note that `pl_fc_entails` doesn't use an ordinary `KB` instance. \n",
    "The knowledge base here is an instance of the `PropDefiniteKB` class, derived from the `PropKB` class, \n",
    "but modified to store definite clauses.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The main point of difference arises in the inclusion of a helper method to `PropDefiniteKB` that returns a list of clauses in KB that have a given symbol `p` in their premise."

    "### Effective Propositional Model Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous segments elucidate the algorithmic procedure for model checking. \n",
    "In this segment, we look at ways of making them computationally efficient.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The problem we are trying to solve is conventionally called the _propositional satisfiability problem_, abbreviated as the _SAT_ problem.\n",
    "In layman terms, if there exists a model that satisfies a given Boolean formula, the formula is called satisfiable.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The SAT problem was the first problem to be proven _NP-complete_.\n",
    "The main characteristics of an NP-complete problem are:\n",
    "- Given a solution to such a problem, it is easy to verify if the solution solves the problem.\n",
    "- The time required to actually solve the problem using any known algorithm increases exponentially with respect to the size of the problem.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Due to these properties, heuristic and approximational methods are often applied to find solutions to these problems.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It is extremely important to be able to solve large scale SAT problems efficiently because \n",
    "many combinatorial problems in computer science can be conveniently reduced to checking the satisfiability of a propositional sentence under some constraints.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We will introduce two new algorithms that perform propositional model checking in a computationally effective way.\n",

    "### 1. DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logeman-Loveland) algorithm\n",
    "This algorithm is very similar to Backtracking-Search.\n",
    "It recursively enumerates possible models in a depth-first fashion with the following improvements over algorithms like `tt_entails`:\n",
    "1. Early termination:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In certain cases, the algorithm can detect the truth value of a statement using just a partially completed model.\n",
    "For example, $(P\\lor Q)\\land(P\\lor R)$ is true if P is true, regardless of other variables.\n",
    "This reduces the search space significantly.\n",
    "2. Pure symbol heuristic:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A symbol that has the same sign (positive or negative) in all clauses is called a _pure symbol_.\n",
    "It isn't difficult to see that any satisfiable model will have the pure symbols assigned such that its parent clause becomes _true_.\n",
    "For example, $(P\\lor\\neg Q)\\land(\\neg Q\\lor\\neg R)\\land(R\\lor P)$ has P and Q as pure symbols\n",
    "and for the sentence to be true, P _has_ to be true and Q _has_ to be false.\n",
    "The pure symbol heuristic thus simplifies the problem a bit.\n",
    "3. Unit clause heuristic:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the context of DPLL, clauses with just one literal and clauses with all but one _false_ literals are called unit clauses.\n",
    "If a clause is a unit clause, it can only be satisfied by assigning the necessary value to make the last literal true.\n",
    "We have no other choice.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Assigning one unit clause can create another unit clause.\n",
    "For example, when P is false, $(P\\lor Q)$ becomes a unit clause, causing _true_ to be assigned to Q.\n",
    "A series of forced assignments derived from previous unit clauses is called _unit propagation_.\n",
    "In this way, this heuristic simplifies the problem further.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The algorithm often employs other tricks to scale up to large problems.\n",
    "However, these tricks are currently out of the scope of this notebook. Refer to section 7.6 of the book for more details.\n",

    "<br>\n",

It takes as input two sentences and returns a <em>unifier</em> for them if one exists. A unifier is a dictionary which stores the substitutions required to make the two sentences identical. It does so by recursively unifying the components of a sentence, where the unification of a variable symbol `var` with a constant symbol `Const` is the mapping `{var: Const}`.
